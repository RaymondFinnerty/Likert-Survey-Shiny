# Shiny app - Likert survey data analysis

This application was produced using RStudio and Shiny. The survey data analysis was performed using R and the Likert package. 
The user can view the aggregated responses, or grouped responses by year or department. 
This if for demo only. The survey questions have been scrubbed and the results are falsified.
